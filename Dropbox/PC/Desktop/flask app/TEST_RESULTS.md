## ðŸš€ Ready for Production!

Your RAG-based semantic search application is fully functional and ready for deployment. All core components have been tested and verified to work correctly with both synthetic and real data.

### Next Steps:
1. Start the application: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Upload your documents through the web interface
3. Begin semantic searching and RAG-powered Q&A

The application successfully combines:
- Advanced semantic search capabilities
- Modern, beautiful UI with animated effects
- Reliable RAG pipeline with Gemini AI
- Efficient vector database operations
- Comprehensive document processing
